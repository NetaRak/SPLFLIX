# SPLFLIX

Assignment in Systems Programming course
 
A C++ program that simulates a new streaming service - SPLFLIX. SPLFLIX offers users two types of streaming content â€“ movies and tv-episodes, which belong to a given tv-series. Like most streaming services we allow a creation of multiple users, while each user receives userspecific recommendations, according to his watch history. However, on SPLFLIX, unlike current streaming services, we give our users the ability to choose which recommendation algorithm to use, out of a number of algorithms we offer.
